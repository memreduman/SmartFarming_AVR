# Smart Farming System
The project utilizes three 8-bit AVR microcontrollers, programmed from scratch in Assembly and C.
One microcontroller is responsible for collecting sensor data, appending CRC codes, and transmitting it to the host microcontroller.
The host microcontroller stores the data by type for transmission to the user microcontroller.
The user microcontroller then displays the data to the user.
